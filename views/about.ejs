      Hello there! I'm a software engineer currently living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
      I admire great design as much as I do great functionality, and as a result, tend to do most of my work in Front-End Web Development.
      I absolutely love working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and seeing how my work directly translates into fully functional mobile and desktop applications.
      Much of my undergraduate education however was heavily focused on software development with Java and system development with C, so I'm well versed in those languages as well.
      Through school I've also had to work with version control software like GitHub, design UI/UX interfaces through user studies, and have practiced agile-scrum with numerous development teams.
      I feel confident that I can implement my skills into many diverse applications and would love to work on whatever those may be!
      As an aside, I'm also a vegetarian, musician, explorer, and life-long gamer! Feel free to contact me any time by email or through LinkedIn.
